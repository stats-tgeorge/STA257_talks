## Where did we go?

Well, you guessed it....

## Why learn the history of statistics in the UK and Ireland?

-   Many of the statistics we use daily were first developed by people working in the UK and Ireland.

. . .

Today, I want to bring you on a brief version of our trip.

## Prominent Figures

-   Francis Galton (1822-1911)
-   Karl Pearson (1857-1936)
-   Ronald Fisher (1890-1962)
-   Florence Nightingale (1820-1910)
-   William Playfair (1759-1823)
-   William Sealy Gosset (1876-1937)

## Fun Fact

-   Francis Galton was Charles Darwin's half-cousin.
-   They worked together, and Darwin's work directly impacted Galton's work, specifically, his work, *Hereditary Genius* in 1869.

## City 1: London, UK

```{r}
leaflet() |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) |>
  setView(lng = -0.1278, lat = 51.5074, zoom = 8) |>  # Zoomed into London
  addMarkers(lng = -0.1180, lat = 51.4980, popup = "Florence Nightingale Museum") |>
  addMarkers(lng = -0.1339, lat = 51.5246, popup = "UCL Archives") |>
  addMarkers(lng = -0.3757, lat = 51.8097, popup = "Rothamsted Research") |>
  addMarkers(lng = 0.1149, lat = 52.2043, popup = "University of Cambridge") |>
  addMarkers(lng = -0.7405, lat = 51.9986, popup = "Bletchley Park")
```

## University College London (UCL) Archives {.smaller}

-   We viewed an assortment of archive items.

-   Working papers for ‘Hereditary Genius’: statistical tables and calculations for the number of gifted relations across families, etc. 1860s by Galton.

-   Results of over 8,000 coin toss experiments conducted by Leopold T Griffith. Griffith supplied the data to Karl Pearson, who used them for illustrative purposes in his Gresham Lectures. Enclosed with the exercise book is the 1891 one penny coin used by Griffith.

## Working Papers

## Florence Nightingale (&Museum) {.smaller}

-   Widely considered the founder of modern nursing. Her emphasis on hygiene, patient care, and nursing education revolutionized healthcare practices and professionalized nursing.

-   During the Crimean War (1853–1856), she drastically improved sanitary conditions at British field hospitals, reducing the death rate from 42% to 2%. Her work earned her the nickname "The Lady with the Lamp" for making nightly rounds to care for wounded soldiers.

-   Nightingale was also a statistician who used innovative data visualizations, like her famous "coxcomb" diagrams, to present mortality data and argue for healthcare reform. She was among the first to use statistics to influence public health policy.

## UCL and Eugenics: Subhadra Das

-   Podcast [Bricks and Mortals](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/play/podcasts/bricks-mortals/bricks-mortals-introduction-science-eugenics) (Listen until 2:45).

-   Subhadra gave us a live tour around UCL's campus.

## Not so Fun Fact {.smaller}

-   Galton, Pearson, and Fisher were all eugenicists.

-   "Galton Lecture Theatre had been renamed Lecture Theatre 115, the Pearson Lecture Theatre changed to Lecture Theatre G22 and the Pearson Building to the North-West Wing"[^1]

-   "Summer of 2020, GEE took the collective decision to rename the RA Fisher Centre for Computational Biology as the UCL Centre for Computational Biology"[^2]

## Visit to Rothamsted Research in Harpenden {.smaller}

- Rothamsted hosts some of the longest-running agricultural experiments in the world, like the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment, which began in 1843. 

- Sir Ronald A. Fisher developed key statistical techniques while working at Rothamsted in the 1920s. These included Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and experiment design, which revolutionized agricultural and biological research.

- Rothamsted maintains a rich [open-access repository of over 150 years of data](https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/), including crop yields, soil chemistry, and meteorological data. These datasets are a goldmine for statistical analysis, time-series modeling, and environmental forecasting.

## Visit to Bletchely Park in Bletchely {.smaller}

- Alan Turing and Max Newman, used Bayesian inference and probability theory to break German codes—particularly the Enigma and Lorenz ciphers. 

- Turing developed a statistical procedure called Banburismus, which used frequency analysis and probability to reduce the number of Enigma settings that needed to be checked. 

- The Colossus computer, developed to break the Lorenz cipher, helped automate the analysis of intercepted messages by identifying statistical patterns in ciphertext. We saw the Colossus in action at the *National Museum of Computing*.

## Fun Fact

- Students got to touch and interact with an Enigma machine.

- The exact machine used in *The Imitation Game* movie.


## Visit to Cambridge {.smaller}

- We went on a two-hour walking tour (in the rain).

- Establishment of the Statistical Laboratory in 1947.

- Some of the figures who studied at Cambridge (various colleges): 
  - CR Rao (Cramer Rao Lower Bound, Rao-Blackwell),
  - Ronald Fisher (Fisher Exact Test),
  - Frank Yates (incomplete block design).



## UK Government Official - Dr. Mary Gregory

- Population Statistics Directorate.

- Highlighted differences in government between the US and UK.

- Gave the students a great opportunity to ask about the current use of statistics in the UK.


## City 2: Edinburgh, Scotland

```{r}
leaflet() |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) |>
  setView(lng = -3.1883, lat = 55.9533, zoom = 12) |>  # Zoomed into Edinburgh
  addMarkers(lng = -3.1890, lat = 55.9440, popup = "University of Edinburgh Archives") |>
  addMarkers(lng = -3.2795, lat = 55.9225, popup = "Edinburgh Napier University")
```

## William Playfair (1759-1823) {.smaller}

-   William Playfair is credited with inventing the bar chart (1786), the line graph (1786), the pie chart (1801), and the area chart.

-   Playfair wasn’t formally trained in statistics—he was a Scottish engineer, economist, and political writer. He used visualizations to make economic and political arguments more persuasive, proving that powerful ideas don't always come from traditional paths.

-   In his book The Commercial and Political Atlas (1786), Playfair used graphs to illustrate Britain’s trade with other countries. This was revolutionary at the time and made complex data far more accessible and intuitive.

## University of Edinburgh Archives

We primarily focussed on plots in books by Playfair or written by individuals inspired by Playfair.

## Royal Statistical Society {.smaller}


- The Royal Statistical Society (RSS), founded in 1834 and now over 190 years old, is one of the world's oldest and most influential statistical organizations. Through its publications, professional standards, and advocacy, it plays a pivotal role in shaping statistics as a formal discipline.

- Sepeaker Zhaoxi Zhang delivered a talk ”Story of Scottish Statistics.”


## Napier University

- Location of Merchiston's Tower.

- Owned by John Napier (1550-1617), the creator of the logarithm.

- Now, Napier University is built around it.

- Students presented collaborative project on text analysis with Scottish Gaelic.


## City 3: Dublin Ireland

```{r}
leaflet() |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) |>
  setView(lng = -6.2603, lat = 53.3498, zoom = 12) |>  # Zoomed into Dublin
  addMarkers(lng = -6.2869, lat = 53.3413, popup = "Guinness Brewery") 
```

## William Sealy Gosset (1876-1937) {.smaller}

-   Best known for developing the t-test, a statistical method for determining whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.

-   Worked as a statistician at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Ireland.

-   To protect his work's confidentiality, he published under the pseudonym "Student," leading to the common name Student's t-test.

## Guinness Brewery

As they say, when in Ireland, go to Guinness?

-   Unfortunately, our tour guide at Guinness only gave a short spiel on Gosset. 

-   But, for some reason, the students still very much enjoyed the visit...

## Speaker Dr. Shane Whelan {.smaller}

- Worked at the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland and at University College Dublin.

- A longstanding member and secretary of The Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland (SSISI).

- Founded in 1847, it promotes the study of statistics, economics, and social science in Ireland through public lectures, research, and policy discussions.

## The whole trip, at a glance {.smaller}

-   We can see the itinerary at [bit.ly/STATS_UKnIR](bit.ly/STATS_UKnIR).
-   22 total days!
-   Today, I've talked about statisticians, but the trip had an equally large cultural component.
-   We went to a Football/Soccer game, visited castles, and saw scenic landscapes.
-   The class read the book *The Lady Tasting Tea* by David Salsburg (highly suggested).
