Her work earned her the nickname “The Lady with the Lamp” for making nightly rounds to care for wounded soldiers.\nPioneer in Data Visualization: Nightingale was also a statistician who used innovative data visualizations, like her famous “coxcomb” diagrams, to present mortality data and argue for healthcare reform. She was among the first to use statistics to influence public health policy."

He used visualizations to make economic and political arguments more persuasive, proving that powerful ideas don’t always come from traditional paths.\nIn his book The Commercial and Political Atlas (1786), Playfair used graphs to illustrate Britain’s trade with other countries. This was revolutionary then and made complex data far more accessible and intuitive."
