These included Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and experiment design, which revolutionized agricultural and biological research.\nRothamsted maintains a rich open-access repository of over 150 years of data, including crop yields, soil chemistry, and meteorological data.

    "text": "Florence Nightingale (&Museum)\n\nFounder of Modern Nursing: Florence Nightingale is widely considered the founder of modern nursing. Her emphasis on hygiene, patient care, and nursing education revolutionized healthcare practices and professionalized nursing.\nRole in the Crimean War: During the Crimean War (1853–1856), Nightingale drastically improved sanitary conditions at British field hospitals, reducing the death rate from 42% to 2%. Her work earned her the nickname “The Lady with the Lamp” for making nightly rounds to care for wounded soldiers.\nPioneer in Data Visualization: Nightingale was also a statistician who used innovative data visualizations, like her famous “coxcomb” diagrams, to present mortality data and argue for healthcare reform. She was among the first to use statistics to influence public health policy."

He used visualizations to make economic and political arguments more persuasive, proving that powerful ideas don’t always come from traditional paths.\nIn his book The Commercial and Political Atlas (1786), Playfair used graphs to illustrate Britain’s trade with other countries. This was revolutionary then and made complex data far more accessible and intuitive."
